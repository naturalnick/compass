	"A Compass is a personal mission statement that outlines an individual's core values, passions, goals, and purpose in life.",
	"It's like a company mission statement except it's solely for your own growth and development.",
	"It helps clarify one's direction in life, much like a magnetic compass does for geographical navigation.",
	"It encapsulates who you are, what you stand for, and where you aim to go providing a framework for decision making and personal growth.",
	"We provide you the tools and services that facilitate the creation of your Compass so that you always have it when you need it - right on your phone.",

	"Your Compass is private by default unless you choose to share or make yours public. Reading other's Compasses can be a great way to get ideas for your own.",
	"Trust your inner-self and take time for deep reflection.",
